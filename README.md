.zshrc
======

My personal modification to the [robbyrussel](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) theme for the zsh terminal.

An example

And with a <code>git</code> repository

Configuration
-------------

I'm using the zsh terminal, customized with [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). (I recommend you to installit !)

I'm also using the [Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme, wich I've saved a copy in this repo, with font <code>Consolata</code> 15pt.

Besides, I'm using my personal modification to the robbyrussel theme, given in the <code>farolfo.zsh-theme</code>, just copy it into your <code>~/.oh-my-zsh/themes</code> directory, and modify your <code>.zshrc</code> file so it will use this theme, by modifing the line:

	ZSH_THEME="farolfo"

Or you my copy the <code>.zshrc</code> file that I provied to your home directory.
